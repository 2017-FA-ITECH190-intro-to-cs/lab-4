# Introduction to Computer Science - Fall 2017

## Lab 4 - It's a mad, mad, mad, mad world.

**Purpose:** The purpose of this lab is to start interacting with the user in _JavaScript_

**Discussion:** you may remember the popular children's activity involving fill-in-the-blank stories called MadLibs. A potentially humorous story is written down with blanks inserted in place of some key words. The storyteller asks someone else for words based on their type and then fills in the blanks. The lack of context in selecting those words can result in an entertaining story when the words are plugged into the story.

Imagine the following list of replies that a participant has given:

* Adjective: creepy
* Woman's name: Barbara
* Color: fuscia
* Animal: koala

Imagine that this is the story:

> It was an __adjective__ kind of day when __woman's name__ walked out into the street. The sky was a deep __color__ and __same name__ was walking her new pet __animal__.

If the blanks are filled in, the story reads:

> It was a __creepy__ kind of day when __Barabara__ walked out into the street. The sky was a deep __fuscia__ and __Barbara__ was walking her new pet __koala__.

**Practice:** Study the [Interactive JavaScript Demos](http://itech190.erickuha.com). Make sure you understand how they work. Ask questions if you are uncertain about anything at all.

**Instructions:** Create a web page called _story.html_ that serves as an interactive fill-in-the-blank story program. You should use JavaScript code that uses input elements of type `text` that prompts the user for words that will be used to fill in the blanks in a story and stores the words in variables. The page should be laid out so that the user's word choices are obtained at the top of the page. In addition, there should be a button for the user to click that will gather the user's word choices and display the story in the Web page, using the values of the variables where appropriate. Note that the user of the web page does _not_ see the story until _after_ entering the words and pressing the button.

The content of the story can be anything you like, so be as creative as you like. Though avoid being vulgar. Your story should satisfy the following requirements.

* The title of the story and your full name must appear in separate headings at the top of the page.
* You must have an ordered list of labels and input elements to prompt for the words
* Your JavaScript must use at least one JavaScript variable
* There must be between 5 and 8 missing words.
